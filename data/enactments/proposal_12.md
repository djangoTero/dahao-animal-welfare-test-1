# Establish @rule_periodic_species_review for Continuous Welfare Improvement

**Objective**
Introduce a new rule, `@rule_periodic_species_review`, to mandate the periodic review of existing `@species_profile` entries, especially those with 'UNKNOWN' or 'LOW' sentience confidence, to integrate new scientific evidence and ensure the framework continuously improves its welfare assessments.

**Rationale**
1.  **Implements `@continuous_improvement`:** Scientific understanding of animal sentience and welfare is dynamic. A formal review process ensures the DAHAO framework remains current with the latest scientific discoveries, preventing stagnation in welfare standards.
2.  **Reinforces `@precautionary_principle`:** For species where sentience confidence is 'LOW' or 'UNKNOWN', new evidence could significantly alter their protection status. A periodic review ensures the precautionary principle is actively applied as knowledge grows.
3.  **Enhances `@rule_species_profile_requirements`:** This new rule would complement existing requirements by adding a mechanism for ongoing validation and enrichment of species data.
4.  **Proactive protection:** Instead of waiting for a specific event, this rule establishes a proactive mechanism to identify and update welfare protections based on evolving evidence.

**Proposed Change**
Add the following new rule to `data/rules.json`.
